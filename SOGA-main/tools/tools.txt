# PSI (https://github.com/eth-sri/psi)

## to generate symbolic formula, on the folder containing PSI invoke (eventually with print on file)
time ./psi namefile --expectation --raw --mathematica

## to compute numerical value in Mathematica copy and paste symbolic formula into
Timing[N[ symbolic_formula ]]


# CMDSTAN (https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan)

## For cmdstan installed via conda go to the cmdstan home directory

## to compile the model (from Windows, for Linux use make instead of mingw32-make)
mingw32-make namefile.exe

## to run the model
namefile.exe sample num_samples=1000 data file=namefile.data.r output file=namefile.csv
## to print a summary
bin\stansummary.exe namefile.csv -c nameoutfile.csv

## In nameoutfile.csv look for Mean of target variables

# AQUA (https://github.com/uiuc-arc/AQUA)

## in AQUA-master run
java -cp "target/aqua-1.0.jar:lib/storm-1.0.jar" aqua.analyses.AnalysisRunner namefolder

## this generates in namefolder the file analysis_namevar
## to get the mean posterior of namevar one has to perform the scalar product of the two vector saved as "data" in the file analysis_namevar

# BLOG (https://bayesianlogic.github.io/pages/users-manual.html)

## In the BLOG home directory run
bin/blog namefile.blog -o nameoutfile

## In nameoutfile for every query, the file contains a list of (value, log_probability) pairs.
