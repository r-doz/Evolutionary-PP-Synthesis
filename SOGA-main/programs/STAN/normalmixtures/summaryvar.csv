# Inference for Stan model: normal_mixture_model
# 1 chains: each with iter=(1001); warmup=(0); thin=(0); 1001 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took 0.00 seconds
# Sampling took 0.00 seconds
# Samples were drawn using meanfield with .
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
